  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

  <p>VacationAI ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Apple Sign-In Data</strong></p>
  <p>When you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple-provided user identifier. If you choose to share your name or email, we may receive that as well. Apple allows you to hide your email address, and we respect that choice. This information is used solely to identify your account within the app.</p>

  <p><strong>Vacation Planning Data</strong></p>
  <p>To optimize your schedule, you provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of vacation days and sick days</li>
    <li>Days you want to save</li>
    <li>Your work schedule</li>
    <li>Company holidays</li>
    <li>Your optimization preferences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is not stored on our servers.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p><strong>AI-Powered Optimization</strong></p>
  <p>Your vacation planning data is sent to OpenAI's API to generate optimized vacation schedules. This data is processed in real-time and is subject to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not store your data on any server — it is sent directly from your device to OpenAI for processing.</p>

  <p><strong>Subscription Management</strong></p>
  <p>If you subscribe to VacationAI, your payment is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All your vacation planning data is stored locally on your device. We do not maintain user accounts on external servers and do not have a database of user information. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Sign-In</strong> — for authentication (<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API</strong> — for AI-powered vacation optimization (<a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> — for subscription payments (<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>VacationAI is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete all your data at any time by deleting the app. No account deletion request is necessary since we do not store your data on external servers.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
